10) Metadatacracy is government via individual electronic metadata that individuals can use to manage relations with organizations, and other individuals in their Society. The name "Metadatacracy combines "Metadata" - (information about a specific Dataset), and "Kratos", (the Greek word for Government). The premise of Metadatacracy is Individual Direct Democratic Government via Network Analysis, that enables Networked Governance Analysis for Democratic decision-making.

With Social Networking, decisions can be made leaderlessly, faster than with a Leader. Social Networking allows for Government to have the same functionality for Individuals that Government in the past has had for Leaders. The principles of Metadatacracy can be applied to Direct, Leaderless, Electronic Networking Democracy in Government, the Workplace, and Education.
